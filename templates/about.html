            This project was created to help parents from Hamburg to quickly find kids-related activities/places.
            I am a mother of two kids - 4 and 2 years old. We try to spend all our free time with kids in a way that
            both
            parents and kids ahve fun.
            Therefore the question what we do at the weekend besides numerous hours at the same playgrounds round about
            is
            very popular in our family.
            This guide is aimed to help parents in Hamburg to shake up their usual routine with the new ideas.
